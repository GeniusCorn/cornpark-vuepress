### Hello

### My name is Corn

I am a student at GCU, majoring in Network Engineering with interest in modern Front-End developing.

I joined EMNOTE in 2017. [EMNOTE](https://emnote.nicecorn.com) is a pioneering company of emergency medicine education and research. I now serve as its senior vice president of technology.

I write some side projects and most of them are open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/GeniusCorn).

You can reach me via [E-mail](mailto:hi@nicecorn.com). I played Dota 2 a lot and you may find me on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198145160817/).
